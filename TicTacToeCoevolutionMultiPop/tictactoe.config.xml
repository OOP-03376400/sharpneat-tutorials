    TicTacToe Host-Parasite Coevolution - The goal is to evolve an AI 
    to play TicTacToe. Two populations are evolved simultaneously, with
    fitness being a combination of performance against the other population
    and a hall of fame.
    Scoring is:
    
    Loss = 0
    Draw = 1
    Win = 10
    
    Fitness is the sum of the scores.
