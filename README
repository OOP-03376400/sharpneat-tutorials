# The NashCoding SharpNEAT 2 Tutorials
## by Wesley Tansey

This code is for the tutorial series on how to use the C# framework SharpNEAT to evolve artificial neural networks. The tutorial contains several projects, each demonstrating a different approach. I assume you already have a basic understand of how neural networks and genetic algorithms work.

## [Part 1: Evolving against a scripted opponent](http://www.nashcoding.com/2010/07/17/tutorial-evolving-neural-networks-with-sharpneat-2-part-1/)
Part 1 walks you through the basics of how to setup a new experiment, define a fitness evaluator, run the evolution, and use the resulting network in your application.

## [Part 2: Competitive coevolution](http://www.nashcoding.com/2010/07/24/tutorial-%E2%80%93-evolving-neural-networks-with-sharpneat-2-part-2/)
Part 2 creates a competitive coevolution experiment where the networks evolve by playing against themselves.

## [Path 3: HyperNEAT](http://www.nashcoding.com/2010/10/29/tutorial-%E2%80%93-evolving-neural-networks-with-sharpneat-2-part-3/)
Part 3 demonstrates how to use the HyperNEAT algorithm to leverage the geometry of the game board.
